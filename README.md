# Relational Database Watermarking
Bachelor’s Thesis Project | Shahid Beheshti University (2013-2014) 

Project Overview
This project investigated digital watermarking techniques specifically designed to protect the copyright and integrity of relational databases. The goal was to embed hidden information (watermarks) into the data without affecting its usability for normal applications.

Research & Analysis Highlights
* Taxonomy of Techniques: Conducted a comprehensive review of information-hiding methods, including cryptography, steganography, and watermarking.
* Classification Framework: Proposed a framework for database watermarking based on distortion type and robustness criteria.
* Attack Resistance: Analyzed system resilience against common database attacks such as tuple deletion, data alteration, and collusion attacks.
* Performance Metrics: Compiled comparative tables for ownership verification, tamper detection, and traitor tracing.

Technical Stack
* Database Systems: SQL, Oracle, Microsoft Access * Key Concepts: Data Integrity, Information Hiding, Robustness Analysis.
